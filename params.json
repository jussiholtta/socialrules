  "body": "Social Rules is a game designed to help people be more aware of the implicit social rules in their community/team, see how disrupting changes the social dynamics and to have fun while doing so.\r\n\r\n## Example Game (discussion circle)\r\n### Setup\r\n* Set context (discussion circle only thing I've tried, walking on corridors/streets would be an interesting experiment too)\r\n* Form a circle of chairs where people can see each other\r\n* Pick topic and lock for the game to have some focus\r\n* Before starting the round, remind people that you are not in the discussion, you exist outside the reality of the rounds\r\n\r\n### Round 1:\r\n* Have players discuss 2-3mins about the topic (natural discussion)\r\n* Ask what kind of implicit rules people were following? Write down rules on the wall. Continue to ask what else/any other observations. (to try: ask people to pick 3 most important ones, remove rest)\r\n* Shuffle simple modifiers and have someone split the deck to make it clear that the rules are actually random (to avoid people feeling targeted)\r\n\r\n### Round 2:\r\n* Deal simple modifiers to social rule modifiers to all players. Remind that the global rules still apply (but don't enforce them, them breaking down is a part of the learning process)\r\n* Ask players to continue the discussion for 2-3 minutes.\r\n* Any observations? Open discussion. Remove revealed modifiers.\r\n\r\n### Round 3:\r\n* Deal modifiers to people who lost previous ones. Deal second modifiers to everyone. Tell people to follow only the new one if the modifiers conflict.\r\n* Ask players to continue the discussion for 2-3 minutes.\r\n* Any observations? Open discussion. Remove revealed modifiers.\r\n\r\n### Round 4:\r\n* Deal modifiers to people who lost previous ones. Deal moderate modifiers to everyone. Tell people to follow only the new one if the modifiers conflict.\r\n* Ask players to continue the discussion for 2-3 minutes. Very likely to descend to chaos here already, it's ok to end a round early.\r\n* Any observations? Open discussion. Remove revealed modifiers.\r\n\r\n### Round 5:\r\n* Deal moderate modifiers to people who lost previous ones. Deal extreme modifiers to everyone. Tell people to follow only the new one if the modifiers conflict.\r\n* Ask players to continue the discussion for 2-3 minutes. Extremely likely to descend to chaos here, it's ok to end a round early.\r\n* Any observations? Open discussion.\r\n\r\n### Closing:\r\n* What did you learn?\r\n* Feedback about the game? (great way to generate new ideas and tuning the modifier decks)\r\n\r\n# The Story So Far\r\nThe idea emerged in a discussion about games in a [Hello Ruby](http://www.helloruby.com/) workshop about teaching systems thinking to kids in April 2016. The spark to design the actual game was the need for content for the [Agile Finland](http://agile.fi) Coaching Circle when the booked speaker called in sick 17 hours before the circle. This game was initially just the Simplest Possible Thing That Might Work so I'd have something to present even if I failed to polish any of my other ideas. I decided to play the game again at the [Agile Coaching Camp in Finland](http://accfi.agile.fi) open space. The game generated a lot of interest in people who missed the first session so I hosted two more games during the camp. Many people encouraged me to publish the game and this is what I'm doing now. \r\n\r\n# License\r\nSocial Rules Game by Jussi Hölttä is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). \r\n",
