  "body": "### Social Rules Game \r\nSocial Rules is a game designed to help people be more aware of the implicit social rules in their community/team, see how disrupting changes the social dynamics and to have fun while doing so.\r\n\r\n### The Game\r\n1. Talk\r\n2. ???\r\n3. Learn\r\n\r\n### The Story So Far\r\nThe idea emerged in a discussion about games in a [Hello Ruby](http://www.helloruby.com/) workshop about teaching systems thinking to kids in April 2016. The spark to design the actual game was the need for content for the [Agile Finland](http://agile.fi) Coaching Circle when the booked speaker called in sick 17 hours before the circle. This game was initially just the Simplest Possible Thing That Might Work so I'd have something to present even if I failed to polish any of my other ideas. I decided to play the game again at the [Agile Coaching Camp in Finland](http://accfi.agile.fi) open space. The game generated a lot of interest in people who missed the first session so I hosted two more games during the camp. Many people encouraged me to publish the game and this is what I'm doing now. Stay tuned for the actual content.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nSocial Rules Game by Jussi Hölttä is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. \r\n",
